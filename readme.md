# Purpose

Experimenting with the concept of callbag. A lightweight pattern for implementing Rx with even some extra capabilities.

See [callbag](https://github.com/callbag/callbag) for more info.

It's so cool! No full blown Rx needed. Just using a simple pattern to achieve the same and more!

See [callback heaven video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9-EBbc9fg) for how he came up with it. Brilliant!
